Check out this project on: https://todo-list-aa2b6.web.app/

This project is about making a very simple to do list. 
A to do list is a list of things you need to do, if you don't know what it is.

It use Firebase Firestore to store user's todos. Firebase Authentication to create and authenticate user.
You can also add some todos without signing in. But it wont save any of your todos when you refresh the page.

This is my first project using React. I tried to make it more fun when trying using Firebase, adding dark mode for user only and creating simple, responsive design.
